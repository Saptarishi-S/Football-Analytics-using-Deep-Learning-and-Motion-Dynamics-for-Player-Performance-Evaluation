2.1 Overview of the Architecture
The architecture of our AI-Enhanced Football Analytics framework consists of several interconnected modules designed to analyze player performance based on video footage. The key steps include video input, player detection, player tracking, and metrics calculation. Each module plays a crucial role in transforming physical behaviors into numerical data, facilitating a structured and quantitative approach to performance evaluation.

2.2 Input Module
Video Acquisition: The system starts by acquiring video input from tactical cameras, which are typically positioned to capture the entire field. These videos provide a bird’s-eye view essential for tracking all players simultaneously.
Initial Frame Analysis: The initial frame of the video is processed to identify key parameters such as player positions, background elements, and dimensions of the playing field. This step also serves as the baseline for tracking player movements throughout the match.
Data Preparation: Before further processing, the videos are segmented into individual frames, which serve as input for subsequent modules. This frame-by-frame analysis allows for real-time tracking and feature extraction.
2.3 Player Detection Module
YOLO Object Detection: The YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm is utilized for initial player detection. YOLO's architecture, though complex, is highly efficient for detecting objects in real time, making it ideal for live or recorded match analysis.
Challenges in Player Detection: Detecting players poses several challenges, including background distractions, occlusion, and similar colors between players and background elements. Traditional background subtraction techniques, such as chromatic features and motion-based techniques, are also tested to enhance detection accuracy in complex scenes.
Manual Selection for Region of Interest (ROI): In cases where YOLO faces detection challenges, the system includes an option for manual selection. Analysts can define the regions of interest, helping to avoid detection errors due to rapid player movement or occlusions from referees or other personnel on the field.
2.4 Player Tracking Module
CSRT Tracker: The Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking (CSRT) tracker is selected for tracking each player’s movement across frames. The CSRT tracker utilizes multiple feature descriptors, such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG) and color histograms, to create a robust feature representation of each player.
Feature Extraction with HoG: The HoG feature descriptor captures the local texture and edge information of each player, enhancing the tracker's robustness in distinguishing players from similar background elements.
Tracking Procedure: The CSRT tracker operates in two steps:
Localization Step: This step locates the player within a region of interest using the CSRT tracker's correlation filters.
Update Step: The tracker updates the player's location by analyzing changes in appearance and motion, ensuring continuity in tracking even as players move rapidly across the field.
2.5 Positional Data Storage
Recording Positional Data: For each frame, the position of each tracked player is recorded using bounding box coordinates (X, Y, W, H), where (X, Y) denotes the top-left corner, and (W, H) represents width and height.
Dataset Generation: This positional data is saved in structured CSV files, with files like "Positions.csv" used to store individual frame positions and "Dataset.csv" for the final player performance metrics.
Data Management: Efficient data management is crucial for real-time processing. This module ensures positional data is systematically saved and organized, allowing for efficient retrieval and processing in subsequent modules.
2.6 Metrics Calculation Module
Cross-Distance (CD): This metric quantifies the distance each player covers on the field, essential for assessing stamina and overall activity. The CD is calculated frame-by-frame by measuring the displacement of each player’s position over time.
Speed (S): Player speed is computed by tracking the change in position across consecutive frames. This metric provides insights into a player’s agility and is particularly useful for analyzing sprinting, acceleration, and deceleration patterns.
Activity Count (AC): The activity count records the number of significant actions taken by a player, such as directional changes, which can indicate their involvement and engagement in gameplay.
2.7 Data Storage and Dataset Creation
Metrics Compilation: After each match video is processed, the extracted metrics (Cross-Distance, Speed, Activity Count) are compiled to create a structured dataset. Each player's data record, encompassing all metrics, is saved in the "Dataset.csv" file.
Building a Comprehensive Dataset: This dataset serves as a valuable resource for performance analysis, as it captures a player’s physical and tactical behavior across multiple games. This structured dataset allows coaches and analysts to compare performances over time.
2.8 Applications of the Proposed System
Training Optimization: Coaches can use the system’s insights to customize training programs based on players’ strengths and weaknesses, as indicated by metrics like speed and cross-distance.
Technical-Tactical Development: The system enables a detailed analysis of players' tactical positioning and movements, which can be used to enhance team strategies and in-game decision-making.
Cost-Effectiveness: Unlike GNSS and LPS systems, which require expensive hardware, this model uses video data alone, making it a scalable and cost-effective solution for teams of varying budgets.
2.9 Advantages and Limitations of the Architecture
Advantages: The system is highly efficient, leveraging OpenCV and the CSRT tracker for real-time tracking without requiring additional sensors. Additionally, the integration of YOLO and CSRT provides a flexible, adaptable framework capable of handling different video qualities and camera angles.
Limitations: The accuracy of player detection can be affected by occlusions and background complexities. Additionally, manual selection may be required for reliable detection in certain cases, which can be time-consuming in longer videos.
Software and Libraries Used
Deep Learning Frameworks: PyTorch and TensorFlow are used for developing and training deep neural networks. PyTorch’s dynamic computational graph and TensorFlow’s efficient model deployment options make them well-suited for video-based analysis tasks.
OpenCV: OpenCV facilitates video processing, including frame extraction, object tracking, and pre-processing operations, such as color filtering and edge detection.
Development Environment - PyCharm: PyCharm offers an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports debugging, testing, and package management, enabling streamlined development for complex machine learning workflows.
Real-Time Monitoring: Real-time data visualization and monitoring were implemented to allow coaches and analysts to observe player performance metrics mid-game, enabling in-game tactical adjustments.
